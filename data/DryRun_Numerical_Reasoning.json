[{"news": "(Oct 7, 2014  12:40 PM CDT) As of Jan. 1, Walmart will no longer offer 30,000 of its employees health insurance. Bloomberg notes that's about 2% of its workforce. The move comes as a reaction to the company's rising health care costs as far more of its employees and their families enrolled in its health care plans than it had expected following the ObamaCare rollout. The AP reports those costs will surge $500 million this fiscal year, $170 million more than had been estimated. Those affected are employees who average fewer than 30 hours of work per week; the Wall Street Journal explains they were grandfathered in when Walmart in 2012 stopped offering insurance to new hires who didn't exceed the 30-hour threshold. A benefits expert says Walmart is actually late to the game in terms of cutting insurance to some part-time workers; Target, the Home Depot, and others have already done so. Meanwhile, Walmart's full time workers will see their premiums rise in 2015. Premiums for the basic plan, which 40% of its workforce is on, will increase 19% to $21.90 per pay period come Jan. 1.", "masked headline": "____K Walmart Part-Timers to Lose Health Insurance", "calculation": "Paraphrase(30,000,K)", "ans": "30"}, {"news": "(Dec 21, 2011  5:52 PM) A burglar made a huge mistake yesterday when he decided to break into the Manhattan apartment of a computer geek who had set up a motion-detecting camera that transmitted photos directly to his smartphone, reports the New York Post.

She was a passionate advocate for lifting restrictions on stem cell research and promoting better treatment of America's veterans. But above all, Nancy Reagan was a fiercely devoted wife.  My life began with Ronnie,  she told Vanity Fair magazine in 1998. The first lady's public life had its share of controversy but also earned the respect of the nation, making Nancy Reagan one of America's most admired women in the 1980s and beyond. Anne Frances  Nancy  Robbins was born on July 6, 1921 in New York City to Kenneth Robbins, a car salesman, and Edith Luckett Robbins, an actress. She met Ronald Reagan in 1950, when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild and she was seeking help with a problem: Her name had been wrongly included on a published list of suspected communist sympathizers. They discussed it over dinner, and she later wrote that she realized on that first blind date  he was everything that I wanted.  They wed two years later, on March 4, 1952. She was thrust into the political life when her husband ran for California governor in 1966 and won. She found it a surprisingly rough business.

The topic: issues facing transgender people after an anti-discrimination ordinance was passed. The canvassers took 10 minutes to explain the ordinance, ask voters for their take on transgender people, and have the voters recall a time when they themselves were judged for being different, thus encouraging  voters to see how their own experience offered a window into transgender people's experiences.

Or should we say yoofs? In a report published Thursday, linguistic experts at the University of York predict major changes in Brits' pronunciation of the English language by 2066, the Sun reports. According to the Telegraph, those changes include the complete disappearance of the voiced dental nonsibliant fricative, also known as the  th  sound. It will be replaced with the  f,   d,  and  v  sounds, so  thick  becomes  fick  and  mother  becomes  muvver.  Other changes include words like  cute  and  beauty  becoming  coot  and  booty,  the  w  and  r  sounds becoming indistinguishable, and the dropping of  l  sounds at the end of words. Researchers studied 50 years of language recordings and current social media to make their predictions, which the Guardian sums up in a sentence:  I totes fink that car is a booty.  (Your Newser editors have no idea why the newspaper didn't change  that  to  dat  in dat example.) Researchers believe the changes will be spurred on by immigrants, who have a hard time pronouncing the  th  sound; the increased use of voice command; the prevalence of the American accent in pop culture; and the fact that most computers are developed in California. They found that in 50 years, age\u2014not class\u2014will be the biggest determinant of how people speak.

A report released Friday counted at least 241 reports of close encounters between drones and manned aircraft that meet the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of a near-collision, including 28 incidents in which pilots had to veer out of the way. The analysis by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone found that 90 of the close drone encounters involved commercial jets. The FAA defines a near-collision as two aircraft flying within 500 feet of each other. In 51 of the incidents studied, the drone-to-aircraft clearance was 50 feet or less, the report said. Most of the sightings occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet. Those are spaces in which the FAA prohibits drones from flying, raising questions about the effectiveness of the rules. The cities with the most incidents were New York, Newark, Los Angeles, and Miami. The report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that it's hard for pilots to judge their distance from another object when flying at high speeds.
